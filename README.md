# Two disk method for generating cubic quadrangulation

Usage: `python3 two_disk.py`

This is the two-disk algorithm refered to in our paper, 
[Which Cubic Graphs have Quadrangulated Spherical Immersions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05461)

See my [note](http://yberman.com/cubic-quadrangulations) on the problem.
